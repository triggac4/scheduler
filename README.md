# Todo app
please do forget the worldclock title i tend to put random names as my project name ..
but dont worry i still find them

this app is just your regular todo application .. you select your time the urgency title and describe what its all about then save it to the sqflite database 
beautifle dependency by the way .. being from sqlite i had to create a singleton class perform crud operations saved my dateTime object as a string then parsed it back to datatime when the app lunches ..note i delete the database when the todolist is empty just to trying tomake sure the id doesnt grow to like 1000 ..but i should have just used UniqueKey() lol..

enjoyyy and clone away
